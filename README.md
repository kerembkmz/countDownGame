# countDownGame
CountDown is a British game show involving word and number tasks. The game constants are two large numbers and four small numbers and we get a random number generated, an example is 75, 50, 2, 3, 8 and randomly generated number is 812. To reach the generated numbers, only 4 basic operations can be used and all it is not mandatory to use all the nubmers. Our math teacher Mr Ryan Nickerson was making the whole class play the game in the last 10 min's of our math class and I wanted to write a program that was going to calculate the possible solutions and return the best one. This is the end product that works in terminal.
